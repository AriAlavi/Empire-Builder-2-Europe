LoadingScreen/Help03=Watch out for centralization. Low centralization decreases yields of all non-resource buildings. Centralization is increased by your capitol, regional capitol, and highways connected to a capitol/regional capitol.
LoadingScreen/Help04=Join the discord server in the description for tips and to be notified whenever a lobby is made.
LoadingScreen/Help05=There are two components to research: point genration and research speed. Point generation is set by the research slider under the economy subtab. Research speed is set by the level of the research lab. Research speed dictates how fast research points can be spent.
LoadingScreen/Help06=This map is full of tooltips. Some provide stats, others provide help to new players. Ever tried hovering over the flag?
LoadingScreen/Help07=When paying for resourecs on the market you are also paying for the fuel to transport them. Distance often can decide the corporation offering the lowest price. Securing a cheap source of oil can reduce food and metal prices.
LoadingScreen/Help08=The AI gets harder as the population of Europe increases (to a point). If the population of Europe passes 1 million, it's in danger if being invaded by the United Americas.
LoadingScreen/Help09=Your credit score increases as you pay back debt and your GDP increases. Better credit score decreases your interest rate, as do some techs.
LoadingScreen/Help10=Any nation with a strong economy can choose to end the world. The Fully Automated Economy project will destroy everyone's economy over time, The world eater virus spreads easily and will destroy all civilizations it reaches. Halcyon nukes can destroy 1/4 th of the entire continent each. 
LoadingScreen/Help11=Being president of the European Union, even if not collecting taxes, is a powerful position. Additionally, in PvP and PvE game modes, the EU troops can be a strong force that is summoned quickly. Note that EU armies will only attack Russians/Americans. EU militia will fight any enemies.
LoadingScreen/Help12=The Russian AI is adaptive. If they notice a lack of air defenses, they will bring air units. Lots of defenses? They'll bring tanks. Don't keep building the same unit and not expect the Russians to start building its hard counter.
LoadingScreen/Help13=On harder difficulties, the AI uses nukes. Russians like to nuke high-pop civilian areas and generally nuke in retaliation to attacks. Americans like to nuke unit production and armies consistently. 
LoadingScreen/Help14=Astros interceptors can not only intercept planes, but nukes as well. They're a good stopgap before you can research static anti-nuke missiles. 
LoadingScreen/Help15=Any nation with a strong economy can choose to end the world. The Fully Automated Economy project will destroy everyone's economy over time, 
LoadingScreen/Help16=An army of zombies is a hard counter to an enemy infantry only army or to an undefended civilian population. 
LoadingScreen/Help17=STOP BUILDING DEFENSES AT CHOKE POINTS! You'll have a few units shooting at many advancing units! Build defenses behind choke points that way only a few enemy units can engage your many defenses!
LoadingScreen/Help18=An AI rebellion will happen if there's too many AI-infused units on the map. During an AI rebellion, all nations with any level of AI researched will have their units join the rebellion. Your factories and airports will switch sides too. The AI will capture resources and power stations in order to build more units.
LoadingScreen/Help19=Food is the only resource directly traded by players with no corporations as the middlemen. However, delivering food costs fuel - corporations will still profit from food trades.
LoadingScreen/Help20=Weak corporations can afford to maintain an army for a month or two to capture a nearby resource. Strong corporations will maintain a standing army to patrol and defend valuable resources. If a corporation doesn't fear the consequences, it will invade other player's resources.
LoadingScreen/Help21=You can use the investment slider and the stock target slider to set aside money each month to invest into a corporation and to choose how much stock in a corporation to buy respectively. Corporations which you have equity in will pay you dividends. You can also sell stock once the price increases.
LoadingScreen/Help22=Civilian demand increases with a higher GDP/capita and with certain government types. It's a double edged sword in that civilians will drive resource prices higher by purchasing them. It allows import tariffs to generate far greater revenue. At the same time, high demand increases prices of domestic goods.
LoadingScreen/Help23=If high resource prices are getting you down, check to see which corporations are benefiting from them. If it's your own corporation, "legally" nationalize it and increase the resource share in the economy tab. If it's someone else's corporation, buy them out or invade their country.
LoadingScreen/Help24=Tariffs can be very useful. High import tariffs on a player will allow your corporation to get first dibs on you and your civilian population's resource purchases. High export tariffs (more effective with strong corporation) on a player will increase how much they have to pay for resources and provide you revenue.
LoadingScreen/Help25=If you hover over the name of a corporation in the corporation, tab you can see what their yearly budget allocation is. Every year they set their budgets on certain activities such as: expansion, upgrades, and research.

With fading radiation, great powers, who have hibernated through nuclear winter, are now emerging from their caves to dominate the world once again.<n/>We are what remains of the European State. Our allies, the Middle East Confederation have provided us with the supplies to rekindle the fire of civilization in Europe. Even with help, our efforts will not be so easy...<n/>The Russian Federation, with bureaucratic AI gone insane, are not open to diplomacy and will seek to remove all life from Europe - vestige programming from the war. In our economic growth, the Americans may find opportunity in invading our continent - we will throw them out if they try.<n/>Brave settlers, beset by vast legions of enemies, go forth and rebuild Europe!
